finish local_partition digest gossip implementation

test_local_partition test:
    - fixture with main and peer
    - main writes a record
    - performs enough compactions to reach the gossip threshold
    - writes additional records
    - pre-condition: peer digest knows of original records only
    - poll_digest_gossip
    - validation step: peer digest of local partition knows of all records

update eventual-consistency tests to check for digest update
update replication tests to check for digest update
    - move to local_partition tests?
